# Lucia CLI
A CLI for [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/).

## Usage
for now just clone the repo and run the main script with [Deno](https://deno.land/).

```sh
deno run -A ./main.ts
```
or if you are on posix systems (Linux, MacOS, etc.) you can run the `lucia` script provided.
```sh
chmod +x ./lucia # make the script executable, you only need to do this once
```
and then
```sh
./lucia
```
